$A$: commutative ring
$t_1, \dots, t_n$ are algebraically independent elements over A
$s_1, \dots, s_n$ are elementary symmetric polynomial in $t_1, \dots, t_n$

Theorem 6.1.
$f(t_1, \dots, t_n) \in A[t_1, \dots, t_n]$ is symmetric polynomial of degree $d$,
then there exists a polynomial $g(t_1, \dots, t_n)$ of weight $\le d$ such that
$$
f(t_1, \dots, t_n) = g(s_1, \dots, s_n)
$$

Proof: By double induction.

$$
f(t_1, \dots, t_n) = g_1(s_1, \dots, s_{n-1}) + s_n g_2(s_1, \dots, s_n)
$$
