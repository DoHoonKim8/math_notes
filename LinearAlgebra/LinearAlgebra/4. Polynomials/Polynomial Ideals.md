Lemma.
Let $f, d$ are non-zero polynomials over $F$, and $deg (d) \leq deg (f)$, then we can choose $g$ such that
$$
f - dg = 0 \;or \;deg(f - dg) < deg (f)
$$
Theorem 4.
If $f, d$ are polynomials over $F$, and $d$ is non-zero polynomial, then there exist polynomials $q, r$ in $F[x]$ such that

- $f = dq + r$
- $r = 0 \;or \;deg(r) < deg(d)$

Corollary.

Definition.
root, a zero

Corollary 2.

Definition.
An **ideal** in $F[x]$ is a subspace $M$ of $F[x]$ such that $fg$ belongs to $M$ whenever $f$ is in $F[x]$ and $g$ is in $M$

**principal ideal generated by** d

Theorem 7.
$F$가 field이고, $M$이 $F[x]$의 non-zero ideal일 때, $M$을 generate하는 unique한 monic polynomial이 항상 존재한다.

Definition.
$p_1, \dots, p_n$ are polynomials over $F$ not all of which is 0, the "monic" generator of the ideal $p_1F[x] + \dots + p_nF[x]$ is called **greatest common divisor** of $p_1, \dots, p_n$.

g.c.d $d$ of $p_1, \dots, p_n$ is
- in the ideal $p_1F[x] + \dots + p_nF[x]$
- $d$ divides each of the $p_1, \dots, p_n$
- every polynomial which divides $p_1, \dots, p_n$ divides $d$
