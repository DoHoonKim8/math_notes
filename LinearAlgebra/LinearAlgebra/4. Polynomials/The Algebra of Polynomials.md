$F[x]$가 $F^{\infty}$의 subspace이고 $1, x, x^2, \dots$ 에 의해 span될 때 $F[x]$의 원소를 polynomial over $F$라고 정의

Thm 1. Let $f, g$ be non-zero polynomials in $F$
- $fg$ is non-zero polynomial
- $def(fg) = deg(f) + deg(g)$
- $fg$ is a monic polynomial if $f$ and $g$ are both monic polynomials
- $fg$ is a scalar polynomial if and only if $f$ and $g$ are both scalar polynomials
- if $f+g \neq 0$ then, $deg(f+g) <= max(deg f, deg g)$

Corollary.
$F[x]$ with the vector addition and multiplication in $F^{\infty}$ forms commutative linear algebra with identity

Corollary.
$f, g, h$ is polynomials in $F$, and $f$ is non-zero polynomial.
If $fg = fh$ then $g = h$.

Definition.
$\mathcal{a}$ be linear algebra over $F$ with identity, and denote the identity as $1$
for all $\alpha$, $\alpha^0=1$ 
To each polynomial $f = \sum_{i=0}^nf_ix^i$ over $F$ and $\alpha$ , associate $F(\alpha)$ as $\sum_{i=0}^nf_i\alpha^i$
