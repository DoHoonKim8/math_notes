bilinear form $f$ is symmetric <=> $f$ is represented by symmetric matrix in some ordered basis

Theorem 3.
$V$: finite-dimensional vector space
$f$: a symmetric bilinear form on $V$
then, there exists an ordered basis for $V$ in which the matrix of $f$ is a diagonal matrix

=> Diagonal하게 만드는 basis가 ($f$에 대해) orthogonal함을 증명 과정에서 알 수 있다.

Theorem 4.
$V$: finite-dimensional vector space over **complex** field
$f$: a symmetric bilinear form on $V$ of rank $r$
there is an ordered basis for $V$ such that
- the matrix of $f$ is diagonal
- the diagonal entries are 1: r개, 0: 나머지

Theorem 5.
$V$: finite-dimensional vector space over **real** field
$f$: a symmetric bilinear form on $V$ of rank $r$
there is an ordered basis for $V$ such that
- the matrix of $f$ is diagonal
- the diagonal entries are 1: $p$개, -1: $r-p$개, 0: $n-r$개
$p$ is unique
