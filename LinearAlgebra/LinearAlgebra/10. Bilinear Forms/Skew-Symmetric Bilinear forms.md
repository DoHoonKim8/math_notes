Theorem 6.
$V$: $n$-dimensional vector space over a subfield of the complex numbers
$f$: skew-symmetric bilinear form on $V$, with rank $r$
=>
- rank $r$ is even
- there is an ordered basis for $V$ in which the matrix of $f$ is the direct sum of $(n-r) \times (n-r)$ zero matrix and $k$ copies of the $2 \times 2$ matrix
