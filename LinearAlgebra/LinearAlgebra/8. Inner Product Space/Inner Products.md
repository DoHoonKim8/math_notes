Definition. Inner products

conjugate transpose matrix

norm of $\alpha$

polarization identities
- the real case:
$$
(\alpha|\beta) = {1 \over 4}||\alpha + \beta||^2 - {1 \over 4}||\alpha - \beta||^2 
$$

the inner product is completely determined by the valuus
$$
G_{jk} = (\alpha_k|\alpha_j), \;
(\alpha|\beta) = Y^*GX
$$
