Orthogonal, orthogonal set, orthonormal set

Theorem 2.
An orthogonal set of non-zero vectors is linearly independent.

Corollary.
If a vector $\beta$ is a linear combination of an orthogonal sequence of non-zero vectors $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_m$, then $\beta$ is the particular form.
$$
\beta = \sum_{i=1}^m{{(\beta|\alpha_i)} \over {||\alpha_i||^2}}\alpha_i
$$

Theorem 3.(Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process)

Theorem 4.
Let $W$ be a subspace of an inner product space $V$ and let $\beta$ be a vector in $V$.
- the vector $\alpha$ in $W$ is the best approximation of $\beta$ if and only if $\beta - \alpha$ is orthogonal to every vector in $W$
- If a best approximation of $\beta$ by vectors in $W$ exists, it is unique.
- If $\alpha$ is the best approximation of $\beta$ by vectors in $W$, and if $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_k$ is a orthogonal basis of $W$, then
$$\alpha = \sum_{k}{({\beta | \alpha_k}) \over {||\alpha_k||^2}}\alpha_k
$$
