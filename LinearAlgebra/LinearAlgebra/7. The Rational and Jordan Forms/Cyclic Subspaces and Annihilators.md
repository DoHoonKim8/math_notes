Definition.
If $\alpha$ is any vector in $V$, the $T$-cyclic subspace generated by $\alpha$ is the subspace $Z(\alpha; T)$ of all vectors of the form $g(T)\alpha$, $g$ in $F[x]$. If $Z(\alpha, T) = V$ then $\alpha$ is a cyclic vector of $T$.

Definition.
If $\alpha$ is any vector in $V$, the $T$-annihilator of $\alpha$ is the ideal $M(\alpha; T)$ in $F[x]$ consisting of all polynomials $g$ over $F$ such that $g(T)\alpha = 0$. The unique monic polynomial $p_{\alpha}$ which generates this ideal will also be called the $T$-annihilator of $\alpha$.

Theorem 1.
Let $\alpha$ be any non-zero vector in $V$ and let $p_{\alpha}$ be the $T$-annihilator of $\alpha$.
- the degree of $p_{\alpha}$ is equal to the dimension of $Z(\alpha; T)$
- if $deg(p_{\alpha}) = k$ then $\alpha, T\alpha, \dots, T^{k-1}\alpha$ form a basis for $Z(\alpha; T)$
- if $U$ is the linear operator on $Z(\alpha; T)$ induced by $T$, the minimal polynomial for $U$ is $p_{\alpha}$

remark)
if $T$ has a cyclic vector => (the minimal polynomial for $T$) == (the characteristic polynomial for $T$)

**companion matrix** of the monic polynomial $p_{\alpha}$

Theorem 2.
If $U$ is a linear operator on the finite dimensional space $W$, then $U$ has a cyclic vector if and only if there is some ordered basis for $W$ in which $U$ is represented by the companion matrix of the minimal polynomial for $U$.

Corollary.
If $A$ is the companion matrix of a monic polynomial $p$, then $p$ is both the minimal and characteristic polynomial for $A$.

A -> linear operator T,
$\alpha_1$이 cyclic vector. $p$의 degree가 vector space의 dimension과 같고, monic polynomial이므로 $p$가 $T$-annihilator of $\alpha_1$이 됨. 따라서 $p$가 $T$의 minimal polynomial이기도 함. ($T$를 restrict한 operator의 minimal polynomial과 $T$-annihilator of $\alpha_1$과 동일하기 때문)
