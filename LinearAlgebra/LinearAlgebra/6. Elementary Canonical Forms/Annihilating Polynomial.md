Definition.
Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite dimensional space $V$. The **minimal polynomial** for $T$ is the unique monic generator of the ideal of polynomials which annihilate $T$.

Theorem 3.
Let $T$ be a linear operator on $n$-dimensional vector space $V$, then the minimal polynomial and characteristic polynomial for $T$ have the same roots except for the multiplicities.

diagonalizable한 linear operator의 minimal polynomial은 $(x-c_1) \dots (x-c_k)$이다.

Theorem 4.(Cayley-Hamilton theorem)
Let $T$ be a linear operator on $V$ and $f$ be a characteristic polynomial for $T$. Then $f(T)=0$, thus the minimal polynomial divides characteristic polynomial.
