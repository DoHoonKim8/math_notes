Theorem 1.
Let $T$ be a linear operator on finite-dimensional space $V$. TFAE:
- $c$ is a characteristic value of $T$
- $T-cI$ is singular (not invertible)
- $det(T-cI) = 0$

Definition.
Let $T$ be a linear operator on finite dimensional space $V$. $T$ is diagonalizable if there exists a basis such that each element is the characteristic vector of $T$.

Theorem 2.
Let $T$ be a linear operator on finite-dimensional vector space $V$. Let $c_1, \dots, c_k$ be the distinct characteristic values of $T$ and let $W_i$ be the null space of $(T - c_iI)$. Then the following are equivalent.
- $T$ is diagonalizable
- the characteristic polynomial of $T$ is $f = (x-c_1)^{d_1} \dots (x-c_k)^{d_k}$ and $d_i = dim W_i$
- $dim W_1 + \dots + dim W_k = dim V$
