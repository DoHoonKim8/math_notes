## Keywords
- definition of linear transformation
	- function from vector space V to vector space W
	- $T: V \rightarrow W \alpha, \beta \in V, c \in F \\\ T(c\alpha + \beta) = cT(\alpha) + T(\beta)$ 
- nullity, range of linear transformation
- nullity(T) + range(T) = dim(V)
- linear operator
- non-singular


Thm 3.
A: m x n matrix
row rank (A) = column rank (A)

Thm 4.
$V, W$ be vector spaces
The set of linear transformation from $V$ to $W$ denoted by $L(V, W)$ forms a vector space.

Thm 5.
$V, W$ be vector spaces with dimension $m, n$
The space $L(V, W)$ is finite dimensional and has dimension $mn$


Thm 9.
$T: V \rightarrow W, n = dim V = dim W$ 
TFAE:
- T is invertible
- T is non-singular ($nullity (T) = 0$)
- T is onto, the range of T is W ($rank(T) = n$)
(vector space $V, W$의 dimension이 동일할 때만 성립함에 주의)
