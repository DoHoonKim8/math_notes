	- leading non-zero entry is equal to 1
	- each column which contains the leading non-zero entry of some row has all its other entries 0.
- row-reduced echelon form
	- row-reduced
	- echelon form
		- zero rows occurs below every row which has non-zero entry
		- if rows 1, ..., r are the non-zero rows, and the leading non-zero entries are in the column $k_i, i = 1, \dots n$ then $k_1 < k_2 < \dots < k_n$ .
- row rank of A = dimension of the row space of A
						 = the # of non-zero rows in the row-reduced echelon matrix
	- non-zero rows in the row-reduced echelon matrix form a basis of the row space
